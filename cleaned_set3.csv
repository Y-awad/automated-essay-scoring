6050,3,"The setting of this story greatly affects the cyclists attitude and adversities. The path of the cyclist is through California deserts, which are dry and hot. This first presents the major conflict of the story, the danger of the cyclist getting heatstake. In the reading, the author says, I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly If the setting was in a cooler climate, the author would most likely not drank as often, and would not face dehydration. The trip would not have been as dangerous for the cyclist if the climate was different. Another element of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. In the reading it says, Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. The rough road not only would take a toil on the authors body, but also his mind. While riding, the author thinks,  I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph This shows how his attitude is getting less and less optimistic as well as keeping his mind on his thirst. Thinking of his thirst would only get him more thirsty. The small change in terrain had a large impact on the authors journey. Perhaps the most influential element of the setting is the isolation. Only until the end of the story does the cyclist run into another human. Up until that point, He was all alone, having to deal with his thirst and fatigue on his own. If the setting had been in a more urbanized area, the cyclist could have gotten help from other people, which would have made his ordeal very easy. Also known, that nobody was going to help him played a large role in the mental state of the author. In conclusion, the conflict of this story was set up by the setting. If the setting were not hot, rough, and isolated, the cyclist would have had an easy journey, and the story would not have been as exciting or interesting.

The summer heat was the biggest problem for the cyclist. He had to bike many miles, but he only had limited supply of water. Eventually, his water supply began to run low, which increased his determination to find the next town before he collapsed. It is this determination which moves him from ghost town to ghost town and keeps the story moving. Another big problem was the vastness of Yosemite National Park, which he was biking through. Any wrong turns (which he took, thanks to the direction he was given) could get him lost and thrown off track for a very long time. It was his confusion as to where the next time was that kept him biking, with difficulty and made for an interesting story. An example of the vastness of the park was when he quote, About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first town. This place might have been a thriving spot at one time-say, before the last world war-but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. This quote shows that even after many miles, he hadnt seen a sign of anyone living, which would have increased his desperation to keep looking for civilization.",3,one biggest problem author faced essay surroundings setting story yosemite provided many obstacle vastness park summer heat fact many place abandoned summer heat biggest problem cyclist bike many mile limited supply water eventually water supply began run low increased determination find next town collapsed determination move ghost town ghost town keep story moving another big problem vastness yosemite national park biking wrong turn took thanks direction given could get lost thrown track long time confusion next time kept biking difficulty made interesting story example vastness park quote about forty mile pedal arrived first town place might thriving spot one timesay last world warbut morning fit traditional definition ghost town quote show even many mile hadnt seen sign anyone living would increased desperation keep looking civilization,1.0
